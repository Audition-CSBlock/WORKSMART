# WORKSMART
This project is for the newbies who are new in cybersecurity and want to learn but don't know from where they'll start,from where they'll learn so i made a python program which includes modules with legit links , Invest some time and try to learn one by one dont mug it up all within a week learn from those links, note it down and practice as much as you can then step forward into another module atleast give 6-7months for completing dont complete it before.Self learning could help you to learn more creative stuffs and you'll be 10x faster and creative than other CEH(certified Ethical Hacking courses) Many of the new chaps thinks how to run this python file????? No problem iam gonna provide tutorial how to run python files.
